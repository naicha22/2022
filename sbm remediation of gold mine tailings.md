Tailings are a byproduct of a gold mining process that was common in the late 1800s and early 1900s.Goldbearing rocks that also contain arsenic were crushed and spread over liquid mercury to remove the gold.The mercury was then evaporated,leaving the gold. Giant gold mine remediation project calls for arsenic Apr 27,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32INDIGENOUS AND NORTHERN AFFAIRS CANADA — A significant priority for the Giant Mine Remediation Project in Yellowknife,N.W.T.will be containing arsenic trioxide that was a byproduct of processing gold onsite during the 56year operation of the mine. Long Lake Gold Remediation (Remediation Plan for 20191026&ensp&#0183&enspLong Lake Gold mine operated intermittently from 1908 to 1937 and produced approximately 200,000 tonnes of tailings.The tailings were discharged directly to the environment without containment.The tailings have since eroded into Luke Creek and Long Lake.The tailings are acid generating and leach acidic water that is high in metal contamination,specifically arsenic. Tailings remediation with dredge mining technology These metal products in tailings may be of much more value today due to profitable extraction with modern processing techniques and current commodity prices.Another important reason to remediate tailings is to mitigate any threats and to prevent potential damage to the environment.Different techniques can be used for tailings remediation.

Tackling Tailings: Repurpose and Remediation — XPRIZE Our concept for repurposing and remediation of mine tailings revolved around using talings high in silica,melting the tailings using concentrated solar thermal (CST) energy into a basic form of glass as a substrate for CST mirrors,and using those mirrors to increase the solar thermal energy available in a beneficial feedback cycle. Remediation of cyanide from the gold mine tailing pond by The Zarmehr gold mine was loed in NE Iran,in KhorasanRazavi province.At this site,the cyanide solutions were applied for gold recovery from the ore and the cyanidecontaining wastes were stored in the tailing pond.Sampling was carried out from different parts of this pond.
