Three Dimensional Validation of DEM Using a Laboratory. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a promising numerical tool for the simulation of the complex dynamic particle motion and interactions within mills.It is envisioned that DEM will eventually be used in conjunction with empirical methods to better optimise the mill design process. ball mill simulation Ball Mill Simulation In Wet Grinding Using A Tumbling Mill.A method for simulating the motion of balls in tumbling ball mill under wet condition is investigated.The simulation method is based on the threedimensional discrete element method (DEM) and takes into account the effects of the presence of suspension,i.e.drag force and buoyancy.
