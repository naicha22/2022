What is Cement Clinker? Composition,Types & Uses Civil. Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products.The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3 25 mm and dark grey in color.It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C 1500°C in the rotary kiln. How does Gypsum control the rate of hardening of cement.  · The appropriate amount of gypsum depends on the content of C3A in the cement and that of SO3 in gypsum,and it also related to the fineness of cement and the content of SO3 in clinker.The amount of gypsum should account for 3% 5% of the cement’s mass.If the content of gypsum exceeds the limit,it will lower the strength of cement and it can.
