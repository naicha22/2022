McCoy Mountains Limonite Cubes DesertUSA The one with which we will deal here is called "pseudomorphous limonite," after pyrite.Pyrite,also known as fool's gold because it has tricked many into believing it was the real thing,is iron sulfide,an iron ore.Under the proper conditions,though,pyrite can become iron hydroxide,or limonite. Pyrite Wikipedia The mineral pyrite ( ˈ p aɪ r aɪ t ),or iron pyrite,also known as fool's gold,is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS 2 (iron(II) disulfide).Pyrite is considered the most common of the sulfide minerals.Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brassyellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold,hence the wellknown nickname Limonite Mindat Spezimen 14 cm wide,8 cm high.Typical Salzgitter &quotTr&#252mmererz&quot = residual ore,consisting of Limonite,Quartz grains,clay minerals and others.Iron content in this kind of ore ca.25 48 %.On the top side a thin crust of Calcite crystals,fluorescent and phosphorescent.Found in November 2007 at the former open pit at the Glockenberg Limonite: Limonite mineral information and data.

Wisconsin Geological &amp Natural History Survey &#187 Limonite Description: Limonite is a general term for a mixture of finegrained iron oxides,generally dominated by goethite,but also possibly containing hematite,lepidochrocite and other minerals.It forms from the weathering of other iron minerals,and may be precipitated by iron rich surface or ground water. LIMONITE (Hydrated Iron Oxide) Amethyst Galleries Massive Goethite and Limonite can be indistinguishable.Limonite forms mostly in or near oxidized iron and other metal ore deposits,and as sedimentary beds.Limonite has been known to pseudomorph other minerals such as pyrite,meaning it replaces a crystal of pyrite with limonite but keeps the shape of the pyrite crystal.
