Copper concentrates Glossary Sumitomo Metal Mining Co The remainder consists mostly of sulfur and iron.Copper concentrates are made mostly from sulfide ores.Ores extracted from overseas mines have a typical grade of about 1%.The ores are then &quotdressed&quot at the mine to increase the purity and produce concentrate.Most of the copper ores imported by SMM for smelting in Japan are concentrates. Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores For example China,Germany and Japan are major copper producers that use concentrate from around the world.This diagram shows the international trade flow in copper concentrate.The flow is from major mining countries to major industrial countries (Source: International Copper Study Group).The total trade in 2013 was over 25 million tonnes.
