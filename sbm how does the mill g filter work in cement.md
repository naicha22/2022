ATTRITORS AND BALL MILLS HOW THEY WORK Robert E. The theoretical critical speed of a ball mill is the speed at which the centrifugal force is sufficiently large to cause a small particle to adhere to the shell interior for a full revolution of the mill.The common range of mill speeds is 65% to 80% of critical,depending on mill type,size and the appliion. concrete and quarrying industries representing the UK mpa cement 1all pressures are given as gauge pressures (i.e.pressure above atmospheric) and not absolute pressure Introduction 3 The cement quarrying industry handles many millions of tonnes of powder every year.It is common practice for these powders to be transported by road in tankers.
