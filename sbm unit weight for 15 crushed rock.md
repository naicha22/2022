Crushed stone Wikipedia Crushed stone has one of the lowest average by weight values of all mineral commodities.The average unit price increased from US$1.58 per metric ton,f.o.b.plant,in 1970 to US$4.39 in 1990.However,the unit price in constant 1982 dollars fluctuated between US$3.48 and US$3.91 per metric ton Crushed Stone Volume To Tonnage?? contractortalk Apr 18,2008&nbsp&#0183&#32I'm covering a 700' sf driveway with 1 2&quot crushed stone approx 3 deep&quot.volume works out to 175 cuft (6.5 cuyd) Does any one have a quick data sourse weight to area calculation for basic matierials crushed stone stone dust sand etc. Standard Test Methods for Laboratory Compaction content and dry unit weight of soils (compaction curve) compacted in a 4 or 6in.(101.6 or 152.4mm) diameter mold soils or aggregates such as gravel or crushed rock.Hereafter D4914 Test Methods for Density and Unit Weight of Soil and Rock in Place by the Sand Replacement Method in a Crushed Stone Grades: A Complete Guide The extraction of hard rock that is turned into various crushed stone grades is a great economic indior.Crushed stone is and will continue to be a very integral part of things we build.If you are working on a construction project and need help deciding what crushed stone grade you need,or need crushed stone in bulk for delivery,contact Section 902 AGGREGATES mdotcf.state.mi.us Section 902.AGGREGATES 902.01.General Requirements.The Department may reinspect and retest aggregates regardless of inspection at the producing plant.Provide safe access to the material for sampling from haul units or stockpiles.Do not use spent metal casting foundry sand,unless the contract expressly allows for its use.

Standard Test Method for Density and Unit Weight of Soil 5.1 This test method can be used to determine the inplace density and unit weight of natural inorganic soil deposits,soilaggregate mixtures,or other similar firm materials.It is often used as a basis of acceptance for earthen material compacted to a specified density or percentage of a maximum density determined by a test method,such as Test Methods D698,D1557 or D4253. Fundamentals of Soil Compaction Intelligent Compaction From this equation we see that there is a limiting dry unit weight for any moisture content and this occurs when the voids are full of water.Increasing the water content for a saturated soil results in a reduction in dry unit weight.The relation between the moisture content and dry unit weight for saturated soil is shown on the graph in Figure 3.

Reference The weight of gravel per cubic yard is approximately 2,970 pounds,or 1.48 tons,if the gravel is dry.If the gravel is out of water,the weight per cubic yard is approximately 1,620 pounds or.81 tons.Comparatively,other building materials are much heavier or much lighter.  If crushed carbonate quarry rock (limestone or dolostone) is used,the minus #200 [75 um] sized portion of the rock insoluble residue shall not exceed 10% by weight.Blending of sources and or beds with an insoluble residue up to 15% is allowed to meet the 10% insoluble residue requirement.
