sbm spiral mill process lay outGLOSSARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY is power driven. Spiral Milling: an operation in which the table of a milling machine is set at an angle and the workpiece is rotated and fed under a revolving formed cutter to create a spiral form; commonly Steel Pipe Manufacturing Processes mandrel mill process. In the Mandrel Mill Process,a solid round (billet) is used.It is heated in a rotary hearth heating furnace and then pierced by a piercer.The pierced billet or hollow shell is rolled by a mandrel mill to reduce the outside diameter and wall thickness which forms a multiple length mother tube.
