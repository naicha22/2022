Aluminum Aluminum is 100% recyclable and recycled aluminum is identical to the virgin product.This makes it a much more cost effective source material for production runs.The re melting of aluminum requires little energy: only about 5% of the energy required to produce the primary metal initially is needed in the recycling process. How does recycling save energy? American Geosciences Extracting and processing raw resources (wood,oil,ore) to make usable materials (paper,plastic,metal) requires a lot of energy.Recycling often saves energy because the products being recycled usually require much less processing to turn them into usable materials.Exactly how much energy is saved depends on the material in question.Let's take two examples: glass and aluminum.
