Reference This process is necessary because platinum,even in ore,needs to be removed from other substances.Platinum is an incredibly rare metal that is mined and extracted in a variety of different ways depending on the technological sophistiion of the miners attempting to extract it.

Precipitating Platinum Palladium Refining YouTube Sep 21,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32Using saturated ammonium chloride to precipitate platinum.Using sodium chlorate to precipitate palladium.Testing with stannous chloride.Testing with dimet palladium ore processing deniseohlson Palladium processing March 1,2015.Q.Hi everyone,I'm an MA student at field mineral processing.My teacher gave me a project about processing of Palladium from ore in my selection.But I'm so confused I know how palladium is obtained from,for example,nickel ores,but I have not good references for my lecture. Palladium Mining Palladium Precious Metal Palladium mining uses mostly mechanical extraction methods,which both simplify the process and make it much easier to get down in the lower portions of the Earth's crust.As the reserves in the upper portions become depleted,miners have to dig deeper and deeper to find more palladium. Platinum &amp Palladium Ore Flotation Pilot Plant Tests were conducted in a Denver No.12 laboratory flotation cell with a stainless steel impeller,stator,and tank.Because of the presence of acidconsuming minerals in the ore,the flotation scheme devised for the anorthositic platinumpalladium ore was not satisfactory for the serpentinized ore. Palladium Refining Tutorial goldnscrap goldnscrap 2015 Palladium (Pd) refining can be a daunting task,similar to the other Platinum group metals (PGM's) refining process.This is mainly due to their similar (but different) physical and chemical properties.Separating Palladium from base metals and especially from sister PGM's,is rarely achieved completely in one refining cycle. Precious Metals Refining,Smelting,Assaying and Selling Gold,Silver,Platinum,Palladium,and Rhodium Precious Metals.Precious metal scrap is weighed The scrap is smelted in an induction furnace,a gas blast furnace,or by blowtorch Materials such as borax and soda ash are mixed in to absorb impurities Palladium Wikipedia Palladium is also used in electronics,dentistry,medicine,hydrogen purifiion,chemical appliions,groundwater treatment,and jewelry.Palladium is a key component of fuel cells,which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity,heat,and water.Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare.
