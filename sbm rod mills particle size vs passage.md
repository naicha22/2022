Powder Technology,69 (1992) 119 123 Effects of mill feed size and rod charges on grinding performance Yigen Zeng and Eric Forssberg Division of Mineral Processing,Luled University of Technology S 951 87 Luled (Sweden) (Received September 8,1990; in revised form June 17,1991) Abstract The effects of mill Mining Industry: What is the difference of ball mill. Most mills used in mining rely on impact to breakdown rock to a suitable size for downstream processing.The impact can be rock on rock such as in an Autogenous Grinding (AG) mill,rock and a small ball charge (~10%),used in Semi Autogenous Grinding (SAG) mills,balls of various sizes in Ball Mills and less commonly these days,steel rods in Rod Mills. Ball and Rod Mill Crushers & Ball Mills APT Both ball and rod mills have a hollow cylindrical shell that rotates about an axis.The shell is filled with steel balls or rods,which,when rotated,crush the material down to the required product size.Rods are generally used when a fine product particle size is not essential in the process and are normally run in open circuit,whereas ball. dry ball mill feed particle size tandartspraktijkevenhuis.nl Ball Mills Ball Mills,and other forms of tumbling mills such as tube mills,rod mills and batch mills form a significant type of equipment used for the size reduction of a wide variety of materials such as minerals,ores,coal,carbon products and general chemicals.cement mill particle size distribution simplygreekcoza.
