FACT SHEET Energy use in the steel industry ENERGY USE IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY Most steel products remain in use for decades or even centuries before their function is no longer needed and they can then be reused,remanufactured or recycled.Therefore,there is not enough recycled steel to meet growing demand.Demand is met through a combined use of the BFBOF and EAF production routes. ClevelandCliffs Inc.About Us Commercial &amp Products Industry demand for the various grades of iron ore pellets depends on each customer's preferences and changes from time to time.In the event that a given mine is operating at full capacity,the terms of most of our pellet supply agreements allow some flexibility in providing our customers iron ore pellets from different mines,if feasible. Iron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace The iron ore concentrate is now mixed and ready for the pelletizing process.Pelletizing A pellet plant contains a series of balling drums where the iron ore concentrate is formed into soft pellets,in much the same manner that one rolls a snowball,to make a pellet about the size of a marble (between 1 4&quot and 1 2&quot). Iron Ore and Pellets Vale Iron ore is found in nature in the form of rocks,mixed with other elements.By means of various industrial processes incorporating cuttingedge technology,iron ore is processed and then sold to steel companies.The iron ore produced by Vale can be Taconite Digging into MN Minerals Minnesota DNR Taconite is a lowgrade iron ore.When the highgrade natural iron ore was plentiful,taconite was considered a waste rock and not used.But as the supply of highgrade natural ore decreased,industry began to view taconite as a resource.
