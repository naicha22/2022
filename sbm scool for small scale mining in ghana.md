TABForest has extensive gold mining expertise in its executive and operational ranks.The company has close ties with Ghana's governmental agencies and the Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners,and is actively working on partnerships to help all of Ghana's small scale miners create prosperous projects that will benefit the Ghanaian economy. Smallscale mining in Ghana: The government and the Ghana's smallscale mining has evolved beyond the reach of current smallscale mining legislation.The formalization process enacted in the smallscale mining laws is ineffective because it is unable to capture the magnitude and complexity of what now encompasses Ghana's smallscale gold industry.

Local Eﬀects of Artisanal Mining: Empirical Evidence from impact of largescale mining is in sharp contrast to the artisanal and smallscale mining sector,which in Ghana alone is estimated to employ 1.1 million workers directly (Hilson and McQuilken,2014).Artisanal gold mining in Ghana traces back to the 15th century,when it was known as the Gold Coast under Portuguese and later British colonial rule SMALLSCALE GOLD MINING LAW Legal Portal for Ghana (1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary,no person shall engage in or undertake any smallscale gold mining operation unless there is in existence in respect of such mining operation a licence granted by the Secretary for Lands and Natural Resources or by
