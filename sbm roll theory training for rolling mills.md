Some Basics of Rolling and Rolling Mills ispatguru.com Some Basics of Rolling and Rolling Mills.Rolling is the process of plastically deforming metal by passing it between rolls.It is the most widely used forming process,which provides high production and close control of final product.During rolling metal is subjected to high compressive stresses as a result of the friction between the roll and the metal surface.Leonardo da Vinci invented. A set up model for tandem cold rolling mills Bryant and Spooner described the simple approach for drafting schedule in tandem cold rolling mills and reported that the key variables are roll force,thermal crown and strip shape.More recently,Dixit and Dixit [17] applied fuzzy set theory to obtain a reduction schedule in tandem cold rolling mill using the only one constraint of roll power.
