NSW Mining Methods NSW Mining Mining methods Mining techniques have dramatically transformed over many years,with technological advances improving efficiency and the safety and health of our people,while minimising the environmental impact of our operations.NSW has both opencut and underground mines. MINING METHODS authorSTREAM Coal is mined by two main methods : Underground or 'deep' mining Surface or 'opencut' mining The choice of method is largely determined by the geology of the coal deposit,in particular the depth of the seam below the surface.The majority of the world's coal Queensland coal mines and advanced projects Opencut mine ~ 200 000 t saleable (~1.6 Mt a ROM Fairhill Formation coal seams : Queensland coal mines and advanced projects (July 2017) : Figure 1: Queensland coal exports by type Queensland coal mines and advanced projects (July 2017) : Table 3 : Queensland coal Operating mines Hazelwood coal mine in the Latrobe Valley could become a Oct 01,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Hazelwood coal mine in the Latrobe Valley could become a lake after mining ceases.held after the mine fire of 2014,examined a range of options for open cut mine rehabilitation. Introduction to Longwall Mining and Subsidence ver2 Fig.1.1 Cutaway View of a Typical Longwall Mine In longwall mining,a panel of coal,typically around 150 to 300 metres wide,1000 to 3500 metres long The angle of draw depends upon the strength of the strata and the depth of cover infrastructure and this is generally adopted as the cutoff point for determination of the angle of draw.In Cutoff Wall Technologies in Mining imwafo Cutoff Wall Technologies in Mining Stefan Schwank BAUER Mining Solutions,BAUER Maschinen GmbH,Schrobenhausen,Germany surface water into openpit mines,allow the development of openpit mines extending from onshore SoilBentonite Cutoff wall for lignite mine,Vattenfall,Welzow,Germany. Homestake Open Cut Mine Historical Marker hmdb Aug 10,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32Homestake Open Cut Mine Marker.Currently there are two vertical operating shafts,the Yates and Ross,which extend 5000 ft.in depth.No.5 Shaft is a secondary escape shaft which extends to the 5000 ft.level.There are two &quotwinzes,&quot vertical shafts which start underground.No.4 Winze operates from the 4850 ft.level to the 7500 ft The Super Pit Open Cut Gold Mine Kalgoorlie Western Sep 21,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Views at the Super Pit open cut gold mine Kalgoorlie Western Australia September 2014 the deepest open cut gold mine in Australia.

GUIDELINES ON SAFETY BUND WALLS Department of Safety Bund Walls Around Abandoned Open Pit Mines Document No.ZMA048HA 1.0 INTRODUCTION Under the Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 and the Mines Safety and Inspection Regulations 1995 the principal employer at,and the manager of,a mine must ensure that Case Study Cost Reduction in Wall Control Blasting The Placer (Granny Smith) Sunrise Dam open cut gold mine is loed near Laverton,WA.(Fig 1.) Mining of the Sunrise orebody began in 1995 and is currently mining in fresh volcanics and banded iron formations.For maximum profitability the development of the pit requires strict wall EXCAVATION and BASEMENT CONSTRUCTION Introduction a) Construct a guide wall b) Excavation for the diaphragm wall c) Excavation support using bentonite slurry d) Inert reinforcement and concreting Construct a guide wall guide wall is two parallel concrete beams running as a guide to the clamshell which is used for the excavation of the diaphragm wall. Influence of Stope Design on Stability of Hanging Wall The mine has been developed up to 100 meter depth.Overhand cut and fill method is applied in this mine.Two decline main ways are developed to support the production of mine.Those positions are in hanging wall.Figure 2.Regional geology of Cibaliung (source: CSD).and foot wall.They are connected by cross cut to the ore stope. Mining of Iron Ores ispatguru Mar 14,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32The recovery of material is done from an open pit in the ground.Overburden consisting of surface vegetation,soil and rock material is removed (stripped) to reach buried ore deposits.Overburden is continually removed during the life of the mine as the high wall is cut
