sbm mill slurry operating levelGrinding &amp; Classification Circuits What are the dimensions of the ball mill you are looking at? 40% ball charge is quite high (unless you are looking at a small mill).A difference (duty vs.maximum) of 5% to 10% is fairly typical and you would likely struggle to perceive an energy efficiency difference between the two operating points. Effect of Slurry Solids Concentration and Ball Loading on. The residence time distribution (RTD) of mineral slurry and slurry holdup volume in an industrial ball mill has been successfully studies using tracer tests.Six different conditions of solids concentration and three levels of ball loading were assessed.The effects of the slurry solids concentration and the ball loading on the mean residence time of slurry were clearly depicted in the results. Sag Slurry Pooling Mill (Grinding) Speed Scribd grinding applications where the mill is operating with a high charge filling.Surprisingly the slurry level in the mill,and mill filling had no correlation.The relationship that was derived is presented in equation 2,and the correlation of predicted and measured data presented in Figure 9.The fraction of balls came out as a strong.

Experimental investigation of the power draw of tumbling. In comminution,mill power plays a major role from the economics standpoint and is a critical design criterion.It is influenced by a range of parameters such as media charge level (ball filling),slurry filling,slurry concentration and mill speed.In this work,the effects of these operating parameters were investigated using a pilot mill (1000 × 500 mm).
