sbm angle conveyor gradientStacking Conveyors Superior Industries Since the founding of Superior,we’ve been reinventing and redefining the stacking conveyor.The key breakthrough that put us on the map was the patent of the FD Axle in 1994.This innovation made it possible to transition stacking conveyors from transport mode to stacking mode in a matter of seconds,a process that,previously,could take up to half an hour. Angle of repose Wikipedia The angle of repose is sometimes used in the design of equipment for the processing of particulate solids.For example,it may be used to design an appropriate hopper or silo to store the material,or to size a conveyor belt for transporting the material.It can also be used in determining whether or not a slope (of a stockpile,or uncompacted gravel bank,for example) will likely collapse.
